# 3ML

## Concept
Multi-messenger astronomy is quickly becoming an important aspect of modern astrophysical analysis. With this in mind, we have started a project to modernize the ability to perform multi-messenger/wavelength astronomy: The Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework (**3ML**).

## Code

The code is open source and can be obtained at the [Github repo](https://github.com/giacomov/3ML).

Documentation can be found [here](http://threeml.readthedocs.io).
