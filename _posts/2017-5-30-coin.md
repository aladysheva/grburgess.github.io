title: COIN Residence Program 4
---

I will participate in this year's [COIN residence program](https://iaacoin.wixsite.com/crp2017) to work with other astronomers/astrostatisticians to develop new tools and methods (hopefully for gamma-ray spectroscopy). The Cosmostatistics Initiative (COIN), an international  group built under the auspices of the International Astrostatistics Association (IAA), aims to create an interdisciplinary environment where collaborations between astronomers, statisticians and machine learning experts can flourish.
